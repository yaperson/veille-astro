## A list of interesting things

I realy like to explore all new web frameworks and new tools for dev!

We are in november 2023 So, I whant to list my favorites of the year here, to share them with you üòÅ
I use some of them, or I just check every now and then how it's going, it depends.

### Astro

This website is make with Astro! 

It's a JavaScript framework for make static websites (SSG, Static Site Generator) with very interesting blog features, 
a realy good documentation with a perfect tutorial for make your first Astro website!

Astro work with island principe \[explenation here, it's comming =D\] 

I use IT for all my static website, photos galery, portfolio, blog!

You can use the framework you whant in complement (personally, I like use Svelte in complement) MDX, integrate your CMS, 
or many features develop by comunity, and beetween the day I discovered Astro and now, lot of people started to use it, 
because it's just a banger!
I can write more to explain why Astro i so cool, but I let you test by your self ;)

#### How I discover

I don't remember, but I think is with the chrome extention "Wappalizer", I remember a beautiful site that aroused my curiosity, so I looked at what technology the site was made with and I read "Astro" a JavaScript framework that I don't know, that's when I got stung...

#### Level of interest
