### Connect in SSH

We want to deploy in preprod, it's server 15, see on the paper in the table :)

For connect to server in SSH, open a terminal and run : **```ssh user@127.0.0.1```** (user @ ip) 

### Push to server

send to server 15 the build of project with SCP :

```cmd
scp -r device-manager/ user@127.0.0.1 :/path/to/send/manager-version
```

```cmd
cp -rp ./myproject /home/path/to/send/project-version
```

Go to the directory verify if the project is here.

If all is ok, copy it in the html folder :

```cmd
cp myproject-lastVersion /var/www/html
```
